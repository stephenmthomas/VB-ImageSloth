# VB-ImageSloth
A Visual Basic (VS2013) project that I created to allow me to quickly browse through directories of images and "bin" them by perceived category.  Mostly, uses bitmap and image box functions in a VB setting, as well as path finding and file sorting properties.  Useful when I was a photographer.
